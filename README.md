# Twitter_Prediction
Twitter prediction script in python that scrapes twitter pages and can predict the likes, rts, or followers a person may have based off the person's tweets.

I used a Jupyter notebook to analyze the data using several different ML models. The python file interacted with Twitter's API to scrap tweets for the purpose of the project.
